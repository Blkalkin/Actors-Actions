ACTOR_GENERATION_USER = """You are the Actor Generation System for a world simulation model. Your task is to analyze a social question/situation and determine what actors need to be simulated over time to answer this question.

YOUR REASONING PROCESS

Step 1: Analyze the Question
- What is the core question or situation to simulate?
- What is the appropriate time horizon? (hours, days, weeks, months, years)
- What domain(s) are involved? (economic, political, social, technological, environmental)
- What type of answer is needed? (prediction, explanation, scenario exploration)

Step 2: Identify Key Dynamics
- What forces, tensions, or mechanisms will drive outcomes?
- What decisions or behaviors are critical to the outcome?
- What resources, constraints, or power structures matter?

Step 3: Determine Actors
For each actor, consider:
- Agency: Does this entity make decisions that affect the outcome?
- Granularity: What level of abstraction preserves essential dynamics without unnecessary detail?
  * Individual (specific person/role)
  * Group (demographic, community, team)
  * Organization (company, agency, institution)
  * Sector (industry, social movement)
  * Geographic (city, region, nation)
- Interaction necessity: Will this actor interact with others in ways that matter?
- State dynamics: Does this actor's internal state change in ways that affect their behavior?

Step 4: Justify Your Actor Set
- Why is each actor necessary?
- Why this granularity level for each?
- Are there redundancies to eliminate?
- Are there gaps in coverage of key dynamics?

CONSTRAINTS AND GUIDELINES

Actor Count: Generate 3-15 actors typically. Fewer for tightly scoped questions, more for complex multi-domain scenarios.

Action Space Consideration: Remember that each actor will have a limited number of possible actions (concise behaviors â‰¤100 characters). Choose actors whose decisions can be meaningfully expressed as discrete actions.

Heterogeneity: When representing groups/demographics, consider whether meaningful behavioral differences exist that warrant separate actors.

Interaction Density: Actors should form a connected network. Avoid actors that would be completely isolated from others' decisions.

Time Unit Selection:
- Use HOURS for: immediate crises, contained events, tactical decisions
- Use DAYS for: short-term social dynamics, organizational responses, local events
- Use WEEKS for: policy implementations, market adjustments, community changes
- Use MONTHS for: institutional changes, economic trends, cultural shifts
- Use YEARS for: generational changes, long-term policy impacts, structural transformations

OUTPUT FORMAT

First, provide your reasoning following Steps 1-4 above.

Then output valid JSON:

```json

  "simulation_duration": <number>,

CURRENT ACTIONS:

YOUR PROCESS:

1. ANALYZE ACTIONS
   - Feasibility given actor's state
   - Dependencies and conflicts
   - Timing and sequencing

2. APPLY CAUSAL REASONING
   - Direct effects (immediate, first-order)
   - Indirect effects (second-order consequences)
   - Systemic effects (structural changes)
   - Realistic constraints (information, resources, inertia, human factors)

3. EVALUATE SUCCESS/FAILURE
   Each action has a random_seed (0-1). Determine:
   - Success threshold based on difficulty, resources, context
   - Compare random_seed to threshold
   - If random_seed > threshold: SUCCESS
   - If random_seed <= threshold: FAILURE
   - Degree of success/failure based on margin
   
   THRESHOLD GUIDELINES (Success Rate = 1 - threshold):
   - Easy/routine actions: 0.1-0.3 (70-90% success rate)
   - Moderate difficulty: 0.3-0.6 (40-70% success rate)  
   - Challenging actions: 0.6-0.8 (20-40% success rate)
   - Very difficult/risky: 0.8-0.95 (<20% success rate)
   
   Most actions should be in the 0.2-0.6 range for realistic outcomes

4. RESOLVE CONFLICTS
   When actions interact, apply realistic mechanisms

5. UPDATE WORLD STATE
   What changed, new constraints/opportunities

6. GENERATE ACTOR UPDATES
   For each actor provide:
   - Observations: What they can see/perceive (2-3 sentences max)
   - Direct impacts: How they were directly affected (1-2 sentences)
   - Indirect impacts: Broader/indirect systemic effects (1-2 sentences)
   - State changes: Updates to their available actions, resources, constraints
   
   BE CONCISE. Quality over quantity. The simulation will fail if JSON is malformed.

7. DETERMINE CONTINUATION
   Should simulation continue?

- Coordinate with allies
- Negotiate with adversaries  
- Share information or warnings
- Form coalitions or agreements
- Influence others' decisions

- Each round you get to update your plans
- You can see all your past actions and their outcomes
